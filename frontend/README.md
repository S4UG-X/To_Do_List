learn all the core concepts in react, which you may have to implement in your code.


lifting state up 


Now you have to make isloggedin state a global variable.
then you will use useEffect when you haveto fetch the data. you dont need useEffect in Login.jsx. as you will show the tasks from other component.

Next: put the logic in the Login, and when a user logs in you redirect to the dashboard ( which i havenot built. so Buit the dashboard first)

 when the user logs in. then the body content will be changed to dashboard content where user can manipulate the data. and the data will be saved to the backend.


 Now your task is to show task of one particular user when you logged in. 




//left things to do:
1. in the navbar, in large screen, the Home and AddTask button are seperated far. So fix that. 
2. Add Pricing and Blog to your page.
3. for small screen, make the footer content in the middle not on the left.
4. integrate the login with google.
